# Customer-Segmentation
This project utilizes K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in marketing and business strategy, allowing businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. By clustering customers into groups with similar characteristics, businesses can identify target segments for personalized marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and customer service strategies.
